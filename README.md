## Front-End Software Languages Website

My main purpose in establishing this website, which I was developing personally, was to improve myself in this field by using **HTML** and **CSS** programming languages. For this reason, the project was developed and continues to be developed on the Sublime Text program using only HTML and CSS languages. </br>
Details are available in the project report.
